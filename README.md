## Steps
Page links were checked and fixed. Alt attributes were added to images to improve accessibility. Semantic elements were located. Divs were replaced with more meaningful elements. HTML elements were adjusted to follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. Heading attributes were altered to fall in sequential order. A concise descriptive title was added. Comments were added and CSS selectors consolidated.
